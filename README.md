The ReadMe.md should include the following:

    Brief Application description
    Contributors - In this case, it will be the team Members
    Technology Stack used for the project
    Prerequisites to run the application - Any software that needs to be installed to run the application
    Instructions on how to run the application locally.
    How to run the tests, if applicable

You should be updating the ReadMe.md file as you progress through the project. You should be adding/revising sections as you add new features to the application.
