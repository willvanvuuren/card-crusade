# card-crusade
The ReadMe.md should include the following:
    Technology Stack used for the project
    Prerequisites to run the application - Any software that needs to be installed to run the application
    Instructions on how to run the application locally.
    How to run the tests, if applicable
    Link to the deployed application, if applicable

You should be updating the ReadMe.md file as you progress through the project. You should be adding/revising sections as you add new features to the application.

Our application is a card game similar to the traditional card game war except weâ€™re providing a digital upgraded version. Our version allows users to keep track of their stats and compete with other users in our database.
