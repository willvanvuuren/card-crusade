# Application Description 

For card game enthusiasts who enjoy experiencing digital access to their favorite
popular games online we have our project “Card Crusade”. This application is a take on
the traditional card game “War”. This is where two players go head to head. Whomever
has the highest card wins, that's it!. We have provided an upgraded digitized version with
some nice upgrades. The interface allows a user to register an account in order to log in
and keep track of their stats as they play, such as wins. This game is perfect for anyone
wanting to play online without the hassle of a real deck and finding someone to play
with. Without the physical aspect this game would allow for quick and easy access to
this card game and the entertainment it comes with. This application is easy to use with
login and setting up an account. Even after our home page provides a quick tour of the
application and how to navigate it. Change settings or go into profile to change your
icon into one of Ashley’s original artworks. Then our game page even provides a tutorial
in case you need a refresher on the game. When done, simply log out and come back
whenever you're ready for more.
