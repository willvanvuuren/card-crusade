        You should be committing your code your feature branch of your repository at least once a day.

    Update your GitHub repository with the latest code.
        Every team member should have pushed their code to the remote branch of the repository
        The code should be merged into the main branch of the repository and tested before presenting it to your TA.
        The features should be fully functional.
            The scope of the features can be determined by the team.

Plan for the following week:

    What are the features you are planning to implement?
    To make it manageable, you can create an issue with a checklist on the GitHub project board. Here is how you can do that. The checklist should link to the user stories(tracked in GitHub issues) that you intend to work on.
