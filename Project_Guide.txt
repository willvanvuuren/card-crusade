    A home page
    A server that allows the UI to communicate with the database
    A database that stores user information

        These would be specific to the application you are building
    A profile page (where the user can see their information - optional)

    A database that stores user data (optional)
        The purpose would be to store user's activity to be recovered when the user logs back in
